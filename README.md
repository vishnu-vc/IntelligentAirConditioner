# IntelligentAirConditioner
In the implementation of this Intelligent Air Conditioning System, we are using an Arduino Uno micro controller as its brain. It can process signals from different sensors and can act on its own without the intervention of a human. This system can turn on an air conditioner depending on the data from a temperature sensor and an ultrasonic sensor, which can detect if a car is there or not, in the garage. The system is designed to turn on the air conditioner if the car is available in the garage and the temperature goes above a particular point. The main objective of this system includes maintaining an optimum temperature in the room by using minimum energy.
